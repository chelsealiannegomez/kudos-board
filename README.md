### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the labs helped especially with designing endpoints and with configuring the backend and frontend together.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have styled it a bit more to make it more aesthetically pleasing, but I'm happy with how it looks so far.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think my project demo went well! It was fun to explain what my project did and how I implemented some features.
